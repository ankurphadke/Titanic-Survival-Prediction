# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This is my first data science project and I decided to give Kaggle's Titanic data set a shot.
The aim of this project is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic ship during the disastrous shipwreck.

Worked on Data Extaction, Data Analysis, Preprocessing, and Feature Engineering. Built the following models:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest

The SVM model performed the best and received a Kaggle Score of 0.78468.
